For notebooks execution is not necessary to download dataset, they download it alone from the original repository. By the way, read_dataset(path) can be also called instead of download_dataset(path) if dataset has already been downloaded from user.
It is also available in the /scripts folder in order to run the demo app.

The following is the default dataset used by both notebooks and app.
